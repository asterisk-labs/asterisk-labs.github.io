<main style='max-width: 800px; margin: auto; text-align: justify;'>
<p>The founding team of Asterisk Labs is working at the intersection of deep learning, Earth observation and climate science, and weʼre on a mission to enrich the planetary data commons. Right now, the vast archives of public Earth data, from ground-based sources to satellites, are grossly underutilised. Most of the data are siloed, used exclusively by their respective communities. But single measurements of Earth are only limited views on a deeply interconnected planetary system, and never tell the whole story on their own. We leverage AI to recycle and reuse data across disciplines, acting as a feedback loop in the planetary data commons.</p>
<p>To pursue our mission, we need a long-termist vision free from the barriers of short-term contracts, enabling scientists to carry out deep collective work that goes beyond surface-level collaboration. We are committed to open-science and maximising our social and scientific impact. Thatʼs why we are doing things differently, as the UKʼs first worker-owned co-operative research lab, where we collectively manage the science we produce.</p>
