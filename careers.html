                <h3>Role: Partner Scientist</h3>
                <p>Asterisk Labs, the UK’s first worker co-operative research lab, is expanding its team of climate and Earth observation scientists. You could help us build an alternative to the usual routes for doing research, prioritising positive societal impact and democratic worker control!</p>
                <p>If you want to learn more about Asterisk Labs, visit <a href="https://asterisk.coop/about.html" style='color: #492ae8ff;'>our about page</a></p>
                <h2>what we’re looking for</h2>
                <p>Currently, we are able to consider applications from two types of candidates.</p>
                
                <p><b>Atmospheric specialist:</b> You will initially be working primarily on the Clouds Decoded project, funded by ARIA. Therefore, our current preference is for applicants with existing skills and knowledge in atmospheric sciences, cloud processes and/or radiative transfer. You will be helping to design and create models for retrieval of physical cloud properties from multispectral data, and harnessing those measurements to study cloud-climate interactions.</p>
            
                <p><b>Wildcard scientist:</b> If you are coming from a different discipline and have a clear vision of how you could grow Asterisk with us, especially with ideas for how to fund new research projects, you could be a great addition to our interdisciplinary team. We are ready to consider domains like oceanography, ecology, spatial epidemiology, cryospheric science, or any other field that could benefit from open Earth data. Please note, Asterisk would work with you to seek funding for a project that we co-define, and hiring would be subject to the success of that process.</p>
                <p>Regardless of which position you fulfil, you will be working with us to shape the future direction of Asterisk, and be part of a growing interdisciplinary lab finding new uses for open Earth data. We want someone who looks at problems with a fresh perspective, and enjoys designing and working on ambitious projects that challenge assumptions and asks the big questions. If you’re someone who has used Earth data imaginatively or in an unexpected way, or if you’ve collaborated across different Earth science disciplines, we’d love to hear about it!</p>
                <p>Besides technical skills, Asterisk shares the work that supports our science and our business across the team. We require you to be able to demonstrate some mix of skills in the following areas, or to show a willingness to learn (there is NO expectation for all of these skills, but any relevant experiences will be taken into account):</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Project management</li>
                <li>Financial planning and accounting</li>
                <li>Communications and public-speaking</li>
                <li>Networking</li>
                <li>Fundraising and proposal writing</li>
                <li>Sysadmin and software/hardware management</li>
                <li>Business development</li>
                <li>Interest or experience in the co-operative sector</li>
                <li>Any other administrative or supporting skills</li>
                <li>B2B SaaS lol just kidding</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This is a <b>remote position</b>. We can employ you directly in the UK, or use an Employer of Record service if you will be working in another country. Unfortunately, at this time, we are not able to sponsor Skilled Worker visa applications in order to relocate to the UK, so if applying from abroad, you must have the right to work in your country of residence, and be able to travel to the UK a few times a year. We are an equal opportunities employer and welcome applications from all qualified candidates, regardless of age, disability, race, religion or belief, sex, sexual orientation, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, or pregnancy and maternity.</p>
                <p>We do not place specific requirements on official qualifications and we welcome applications from people with atypical career paths. With that being said, we see this position as suitable for someone who has the equivalent amount of research experience that a PhD would bring. We especially welcome applicants from underrepresented backgrounds.</p>
                <h2>what we offer</h2>
                <p>Terms of employment may differ if you are working in another country, but we will try to make them as similar as possible to what is offered in the UK. The following information is what we offer if employed in the UK.</p>
                <p>We have a flat, transparent salary structure. You will receive:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>£58k per annum gross (with raises agreed upon collectively on a roughly annual basis)</li>
                    <li>8% employer pension contribution</li>
                    <li>salary sacrifice scheme</li>
                    <li>4-day work week and flexible hours</li>
                    <li>30 days paid leave per year plus public holidays</li>
                    <li>life insurance</li>
                    <li>personal accident insurance</li>
                    <li>personal travel insurance</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Alongside other benefits such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Funding for skills and courses</li>
                    <li>Opportunities to travel</li>
                    <li>(Optional) full membership of the worker co-operative and seat on the Board of Directors after a 6-month probationary period.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You will be joining a democratically managed, mission-driven organisation. This opportunity comes with both the benefits and responsibilities attached to our co-operative structure. After your probationary period, you will be able to take part in the democratic process that controls your working conditions and the business. You will not be ‘our employee’, but rather working alongside us as an equal partner.</p>
                <h2>how to apply</h2>
                <p>This position will remain open until a suitable candidate is found. We will begin reviewing applications and contacting applicants for interviews on a rolling basis <b>from 18th August onwards</b>. We will conduct a short virtual interview of roughly 15 minutes, followed by a longer 45 minute virtual interview for shortlisted candidates. We will endeavour to respond to all applicants as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>
